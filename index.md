## Intro

My name is Anna Jones. I currently work as Data Analyst/Data Scientist at Social Point, a mobile gaming company based in Barcelona, Spain.

I've worked at the company for 2 years, having previously worked as a Data Scientist/Junior Ruby Developer at a fintech startup called Novicap. Prior to that I did my PhD in Systems Biology at Oxford University.

Right now, my strengths are in SQL and data analysis, although I can also do analysis using Tableau and Python.

However, since moving part-time to the data science department, I've been working towards improving my skills in Python and R, Machine Learning, and getting models into production.

Over the last few weeks I learned how to run code on an EMR cluster reading from S3, creating bash scripts to install software, debugging by ssh'ing through Hadoop in the Terminal, saving the data to a database, setting up tasks in Azkaban, interacting with models in Microsoft Azure, etc. I find that stuff super cool and I'm really enjoying it. But I feel like I've only just scratched the surface of my understanding and I want to broaden my knowlegde in these areas.

Specifically, the topics I will be focusing on over the next few months are:
- R
- Statistically modelling
- Building predictive models and deploying in production
- Better understanding of AWS
- Hadoop
